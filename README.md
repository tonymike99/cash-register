Problem Statement

    Your program has currencies of Rs. 1, 5, 10, 20, 100, 500, 2000.
    Your user enters a bill amount say Rs. 243.
    Your user then enters cash given say Rs. 2000.
    Now, help the user by telling how can he/she return the change to the customer with a minimum number of notes?

Logic

    2000-243 = 1757
    1757-500 = 1257
    1257-500 = 757
    757-500 = 257
    257-100 = 157
    157-100 = 57
    57-20 = 37
    37-20 = 17
    17-10 = 7
    7-5 = 2
    2-1 = 1
    1-1 = 0

    500 - 3
    100 - 2
    20 - 2
    10 - 1
    5 - 1
    1 - 2
